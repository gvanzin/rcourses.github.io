# Course package Repository

This github repository contains the course material for a number of
[R courses](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths/rcourse/"). Each
course we run has a separate, associate R package, that contains the
practical sheets with solutions.
 
This repository currently contains material for

 * Introduction to R
 * Statistical modelling
 * Programming with R
 * Efficient R programming
 * Advanced graphics



All the packages are located in
the [drat repository](https://github.com/rcourses/drat)
